# Learning Markdowns!
<p>Markdowns is a lightweight markup language for generating html files. There are things such as markdown cheat sheet that have all the markdowns consolidated in one area to guide you effortlessly. But you need to pay attention and check your work as you go! An error can occur with something as simple as a misplacement. Some of the basic syntax are used for Headings, paragraphs, line breaks, bold letters and even Italics. I am just barley scratching the surface on some syntax you can use.

<p>Git hub uses Markdown everywhere it can even convert your Markdown and publish it. When you have a file that ends in .md it's in a Markdown format.


### _Growth Mindset_

Growth mind to me is a way to look at everything as a skill that can be learned.
You also accept there is talent in this world but you also accept there is oppertunity in growth.

 |*These are some reminders I use to keep my self in the growth mindset.*   |
 |-------------------------------------------------------------------       |
 | `Its not the end of the world if I raise my hand and I get it wrong.`    |
 | `There is no shame in asking for help.`                                  |
 |`Everything can be learned.  `                                            |
 | `See the opertunity in failure. `                                        |
