# Structure Web Pages With HTML
## Wireframe and Design
* There are hand-drawn and digital types of Wireframe
* Keep it simple
* Always do a second sketch
* [UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com/), [Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/),and [Invisioinapp](https://www.invisionapp.com/) are some tools that help you digitize your sketch. 

* When drafting ask yourself how can you support your user's goals?
 * What is seen when you arrive at the page?
 * Where are your touch points so your user can complete the desired actions?
* Is the user satisfied with their needs?
* Again keep it SIMPLE!!
