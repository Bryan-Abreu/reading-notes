# Activate web apges with JavaScript
* JavaScript turns websites into something you can interact with.
* Java traditionally is used inside web browsers.
* Running a JavaScript code is called a "client side"
* Web servers run on the "Server side"
* JavaScript Server is `Node.js`
* Any text editor can be used.
* You can embed the JS code inside the HTML or put a line in the HTML file that has an external file
* `<script></script>` is used to write our JS code.
* The alert function is used to display text for the user output.
* The content of the page is changed by using document.write function.
* Developers use `console.log` for debugging by printing information.
* Also, it's mostly used by developers.
- One of the ways java receives input is called prompt. It provides a popup with a textbox where the user can fill in.
- example
    - `<script>`
    - `var name = prompt("Your name:", "");`
    - `document.write("Hello ", name);`
    - `</script>`
- By pressing cancel or ESC the prompt() will return to null.
- Confirm() allows developers to ask yes or no questions.
- If OK is pressed the confirm will return true
- If cancel or ESC is pressed the function will return false
- `If-else` example
    - `<script>`
    - `if (confirm("Shall I print Hello World?")) {`
    - `document.write("Hello World");`
    - `} else {`
    - ` document.write("OK, I won't print it.");`
    - `}`
    - `</script>`
- Variables have different wast to declare them.
- var does not use, it's the old way
- let is declaring a variable that can be changed
- const can not be changed
- a string means text
- end each step with a ;
- string (' ')
- // is a comment
- ctrl + / and highlight the code make it a comment.
- re-assigning a constant variable BREAKS
- Data types
    - Boolean is true/false
    - A string is words wrapped in quotes
    - add space into a string!
    - Numbers/Integers is 10, 20, no quotes
    - == is equal
    - === is strictly equal
    - = is give a value
    - once it is a string it will forever be a string
    - expression evaluates to something
- JS runs code from top to bottom.

* 4 Things common to all computers are 
    - Input
    - Storage
    - Processing
    - Output
- The binary number system has 2 digits 1 and 0. It can count up to any number.
- Images have pixels and have a color code that is a number base and can be transmitted through binary
- computers modify and combine information to give you an output where you can engage it.
- a wire is a bit
- 32 wires can count up to 4 million 
- smaller circuits perform better because it moves fast
- CPU (Central processing unit) is a master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer.
- Binary controls all the software on the computer
