# Activate web apges with JavaScript
* JavaScript turns websites into something you can interacte with.
* Java traditionally is used inside we browsers.
* Running a JavaScript code is called a "client side"
* Web servers run on "Server side"
* JavaScript Server is `Node.js`
* Any text editor can be used.
* You can embed the JS code inside the HTML or put a line in the HTML file that has an external file
* `<script></script>` is used to write our JS code.
* Alert function is uesed to display text for the user output.

- One of the ways java recieves input is called prompt. It provides a popup with a textbox where th user cna fill in.
- example
    - `<script>`
    - `var name = prompt("Your name:", "");`
    - `document.write("Hello ", name);`
    - `</script>`
- By pressing cancel or ESC the prompt() will return to null.
- Confirm() alows devlopers to ask yes or no questions.
- If OK is pressed the confirm will return true
- If cancel or ESC is pressed the function will return false
- `If-else` example
    - `<script>`
    - `if (confirm("Shall I print Hello World?")) {`
    - `document.write("Hello World");`
    - `} else {`
    - ` document.write("OK, I won't print it.");`
    - `}`
    - `</script>`

    - expression evaluates to something
- JS runs code from top to bottom.

    - Processing
    - Output
- The binary number system have 2 digits 1 and 0 . It can count up to any number.
- Images have pixels and have a color code that is numberbase and can be transmited through binary
- computers modifie and combine information to give you and output where you can ingage it.
- a wire is a bit
- 32 wires can count up to 4 million 
- smaller circuts perfome better because it moves fast
- CPU (Central processing unit) is a master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer.
