# Programming with JavaScript
- Control flow runs from the first line to the last line
- Conditional structure is used by the script so that different code is executed depending on the completion
- `' use strict' ` at the top of your code for Javascript
## Functions
    - Function is a block of code made to complete a task
    - Function is executed when something invokes it
    - variables inside a function only exist inside a function
## Function Syntax
    - `Function name()`
    - can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and dollar signs
    - values received by the invoked function are arguments
## Function Invocation
    -when "something' invokes
        - When an event occurs
        - when it is invoked from JS code
        - Automatically self invoked
        -invoking, calling function
## Operators
- (=) Assignment Operator
- (+) Addition Operator 
- (*) Multiplication Operator
- (**) Exponentiation (ES2016)
- (/) Division
- (++) Increment
- (%) Modulus (Division Remainder)
- (--) 	Decrement 
- (+=) Addition Assignment Operator
|Operator	| Example	|Same As    |
|:--------: |:---------:|:---------:|
|=	        | x = y	    |x = y      |
|+=         | x += y	|x = x + y  |
|-=         | x -= y	|x = x - y  |
|*=	        |x *= y	    |x = x * y  |
|/=	        |x /= y	    |x = x / y  |
|%=	        |x %= y 	|x = x % y  |
|**=	    |x **= y	|x = x ** y |
