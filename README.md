# ***My Reading Journal for 102***
Hola everyone! My name is Bryan Abreu I'm a veteran and the most important things in my life are my family, my dog, and cars. I have 2 beautiful girls and an amazing wife that supports all my crazy ideas. I am into the older Japanese's cars I am restoring one and building a drift car. I'm even starting to design my own wide body kit. I am currently working at Tesla as a collision technician. Computers have always been fun to mess with but I never got serious with it until now. Here is my github and hopefully you see some big improvements though out this course. Love you guys and have a blessed day!



### _Growth Mindset_

Growth mind to me is a way to look at everything as a skill that can be learned.
You also accept there is talent in this world but you also accept there is oppertunity in growth.

 |*These are some reminders I use to keep my self in the growth mindset.*   |
 |-------------------------------------------------------------------       |
 | `Its not the end of the world if I raise my hand and I get it wrong.`    |
 | `There is no shame in asking for help.`                                  |
 |`Everything can be learned.  `                                            |
 | `See the opertunity in failure. `                                        |
