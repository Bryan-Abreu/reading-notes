### _Growth Mindset_
The growth mind set is a way to look at everything as a skill that can be learned.
You also accept there is talent in this world but you also accept there is oppertunity in growth.

These are some reminders I use to keep my self in the growth mindset.
[^1]: Its not the end of the world if I raise my hand and I get it wrong.
[^2]: There is no shame in asking for help.
[^3]: Everything can be learned.
[^4]: See the opertunity in failure.
