# ***My Reading Journal for 102***
Hola everyone! My name is Bryan Abreu I'm a veteran and the most important things in my life are my family, my dog, and cars. I have 2 beautiful girls and an amazing wife that supports all my crazy ideas. I am into the older Japanese's cars I am restoring one and building a drift car. I'm even starting to design my own wide body kit. I am currently working at Tesla as a collision technician. Computers have always been fun to mess with but I never got serious with it until now. Here is my github and hopefully you see some big improvements though out this course. Love you guys and have a blessed day!

Here is a link to my [portfolio](https://github.com/djflights/).
Enjoy!
